Thanks for downloading Commander Genius!

Commander Genius is an open-source clone of
Commander Keen, which allows you to play the
original three games, and a majority of the mods
made for it.  All of the original data files
are required to do so, however, we convienently
include Episode 1 for you enjoyment.

Commander Genius runs on Linux/X11, Windows,
MacOS X, Wiz, GP2X and the iPhone, with plans
to release on other platforms in the future.
If you think you would like to port it,
please send us a message and we will do our
best to help you understand the code.

The main goal of Commander Genius is to copy
the original games as much as possible, however
there are also a number of improvements like:
- MMX Support
- OpenGL Acceleration
- Better Graphic Effects
- Multiplayer Support
- High Quality Packs
- In-Game Menu
- Named Save Slots
- Unrestricted Joystick Support
- Many More!

We renamed CloneKeenPlus, because of some major
rewrites in the code, we now call it Commander
Genius!  After the all these major rewrites,
have retained only a very small portion of the
original CloneKeen code, but it was the base of
CloneKeen that allowed this to happen. Because
of that we still honor Caitlin Shaw and all the
work she did on that engine.

The Commander Genius source code may be freely
distributed and modified as per the GPL, just
please remember to give credit to the original
authors. We worked hard on it!

///Old Unchanged for a while part of the readme
///Sorry, but we don't have the time to sort
///through this mess and fix it up for the
///new release, but we will make a much better
///version of the readme for the next release,
///you can count on that!

Setting up the data of the game:

 * Copy all of the data files from the original game(s) into the
   "./games" folder. If you have the registered versions, 
   you can play all episodes, otherwise download the shareware version 
   and copy the data from it. You also can use mods.  In Macintosh you 
   can find this folder by right clicking on the game and clicking 
   open package then going into resources.  If you have a bundled version, 
   you already should be able to play episode 1.
   NOTE: to start CG you need at least Episode 1!
 * If you want to use some patched mods just copy them as a subfolder into "./games". 
 * Go into the Release folder and start the interpreter. If you have downloaded 
   the binary version of Commander Genius (for Windows, Linux32/64), then you 
   will find the executable in the root directory of the extracted game.
   Under Linux it is called "CGenius", under Windows "CGenius.exe".    
 * If you want better sounds and music, please download the high quality pack (HQP).
   Read that readme of HQP for more information how to use those resources.
   Also try out our new tileset. They are great!
   Using HQP you might have to copy some resources to the specific game directory so
   CG would detect it. For example you might want to copy ck1tiles.bmp to ./games/keen1/
 * If your monitor and graphic card support a special resolution, you can add it by
   modifying "resolutions.cfg" with your favorite text-editor. It can be found in the
   "./data" directory and you simply have to add in resolutions as "width"x"height"x"depth"
   (depth should always be 32 in the case of a normal computer. Embedded System can use 16 
   for better performance).
 
Howto use Commander Genius (If you didn't compile it):
 * Go to the game directory.
 * Under Windows you start "CGenius.exe", under Linux "./CGenius"

Howto compile it under Ubuntu (testet on Karmic):
 * This is based on the source code that we provide on our website
 * As we know which packages are needed, because we use Ubuntu, here is an extra guide. 
 * Install through Synaptic or "sudo apt-get install" following packages:
 	- build-essential
 	- libvorbis-dev
 	- libsdl1.2-dev
 	- libgl1-mesa-dev
 * extract my source code into "CGenius".
 * cd into the "CGenius/Linux32" or "CGenius/Linux64" subdirectory depending on your system.
 * Run "make".
 * Then, you can run "CommanderGenius". Copy the files, wherever you want them together 
   with the data directory. "make install" does not work though.
 * We also provide CMake for wiz. If you want to compile it for embedded systems.
   We had support for Linux and Win32, but since there is a bug when build, for
   different Linux build (32-bit or 64-bit) we only use it for embedded systems.

Compiling CG on any Linux/UNIX (other than Ubuntu):
 * If you want to compile the game, you need to have all the standard
   development libraries and GNU C Compiler (at least version 4) installed 
   on your system.
 * You need to install the "vorbis", "SDL" and "Mesa/OpenGL" development libraries to get 
   it successfully compiled.
 * extract my source code to "cgenius". 
 * cd into the "cgenius/Release" subdirectory.
 * Run "make".
 * Then, you can run "CommanderGenius". Copy the files, 
   wherever you want them together with the data directory. 
   "make install" does not work though.
   
- VIDEO SYSTEM -
Being cross-platform, there are many methods to detect different resolutions on a system.

Generally it is not necessary, because many resolutions are already supported, but if 
you want to support other resolutions that you don't find in the options list just modify the
"resolutions.cfg" file by hand. CG always reads this file and checks whether your card and 
monitor support it.

CAUTION: This is recommended for advanced users who know what they do. The team won't take 
responsibilities if you use a wrong configuration. If you want to see other resolutions to 
in future versions of CG, mail us ;-).

- GAME PLAY -
Before you play the game, you should take a look at the controls. Normally LAlt, Ctrl, Space and Enter
are the action keys. You can also assign joystick buttons and axes to those actions.

- CHEAT CODES -
There are a full assortment of cheat codes available. Some cheats must first
be enabled with -cheat or through the options->game menu. C+T+SPACE and G+O+D will
always work.

KEY        	ACTION             DESCRIPTION
G+O+D	   	godmode			   In god mode you are invincible!
C+T+SPACE  	All Items          Gives all items, similar to the original.
LSHIFT+TAB 	Skip Level         Holding down this key you can skip levels and walk through tiles
							   on the map.
TAB			No clipping		   If you hold down this key you will disable clipping.
							   However, you cannot fall though floors. 

- SAVE/LOAD GAME -
The game can be saved by pressing F3 at any point during the game or using the menu.
The game will be saved in the exact position it was left (unlike the original which only
allowed save at the map).

- DEMO -
This feature is disabled for now, but we hope to reenable it soon!

- FAQ -
Q: When I change to opengl-mode, the screen gets white and I can't do anything! I have to kill the program.
   What can I do to restore the normal mode?

A: You can delete "cgenius.cfg" or change it the way you need it! Just put "opengl = 0" and it should normal
   with your previous settings. We are working on a solution for that! The white screen means, that your 
   graphic card doesn't support NPOT Textures, which is required. 
   A video card with OpenGL 2.0 or later support should not have that problem.
   
Q: Why not to use POT-Textures?
A: Because it requires more memory to write, and the game would get slower than with software rendering.
   We are working on a new method to get it working with POT Textures and faster, but for now we cannot
   support it. 

Q: Commander Genius is slow? Please help!
A: You can decrease the fps under settings->video what is very
   recommended for any system. OpenGL may also help, but you must have a gfx-card that support NPOT-Textures.
   (OpenGL 2.0 or later). Try to lower the resolution, a lower filter, or decrease some stuff in the sound section.
   Stereo sound requires additional calculations than mono sound. There are many things you can do, to speed up
   the program.

- BUG! -
So you really found one or more bugs? Please report me those per e-mail (gerstrong@gmail.com) or at
the SourceForge.Net Trac system we offer and they will be checked by all of us. 
Depending on the priority, I'm going to fix them as soon as possible. 
Sending me the "CGLog.html" or "stdout.txt" file might help tracking the error.
Also remember to test the version from the testing repo we provide. You error might have been fixed there.
Those versions are really great!
