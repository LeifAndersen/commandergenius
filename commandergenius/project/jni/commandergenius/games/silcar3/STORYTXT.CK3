~           "Onward: Silcar"


Billy Blaze, eight year-old genius, working diligently in his backyard
clubhouse has created an interstellar starship from old soup cans, rubber
cement and plastic tubing.  While his folks are out on the town and the
babysitter has fallen asleep, Billy travels into his backyard workshop, dons
his brother's football helmet, and transforms into...

  COMMANDER KEEN--defender of Earth!

In his ship, the Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket, Keen dispenses galactic justice
with an iron hand!


~   STORY SO FAR

Keen secured the stolen parts of his grandmas precious tea-set from the
strange planet "Strgwz". As he was on his way back home, he saw a whole
fleet that was apparently monitoring his quest. Keen found out it was 
controlled by the Evil Eyes. But one of them gave him a hint to come to
the planet Silcar.

~   WHAT KEEN MUST DO

The planet Silcar is not a hostile planet, but right now the normally
peaceful Salcs are being controlled by an evil force, the Evil Eye referred
to as "The GANNALECH". This could only mean they stand in contact with
the Shikadi.
Keen is sure this is the work of his arch-nemesis Mortimer McMire once 
again. Keen has to find the evil force and stop it to free the Salcs.
Fortunately there is a Salc underground movement trying to help Keen.
The gave him the save landing coordinates, and they provided some useful tools
Keen will find on his quest.
They invented an anti-gravity device that can be attached to Keen's pogo
stick. But it only lasts a few seconds until its energy is used up.

~         INFORMATION ON SILCAR

Silcar is a blueish planet without oceans, but not dry. There are special
trees, the Qum-Trees, normally grow in a symetric way. There are other 
plants and giant mushrooms as well. The Salc architecture consists mostly
of old buildings, some of them even thousands of years old. But there are
also new military structures. You will identify them with one glance, as
they don't fit in with the scenery and are generally ugly industrial blocks.

~        THE ADVENTURE BEGINS...

Your task is before you.  Go get 'em, Commander Keen!
