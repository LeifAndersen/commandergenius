IMPORTANT KEYS

If you cannot pass through a door, there may be a "keycard" that the door requires. Also there are security doors that can be opened by a "key". This will be the same color as the door.

<>If you get one of these anti-gravity machines, you can fly when you use it with your pogo stick, but it only works for a limited time. Just tip on your pogo button shortly and you'll fly right up.

	Salc: You should know them by now. Here they are controlled by the evil eyes, and will shoot at random targets.

	Mover: A small fast creature you know from episode one. Fortunately it isn't that dangerous.

	Boo: A translucent ghost that roams the darker places of Silcar. It cannot be killed as it is technically dead already.

	Mural: This wormlike being lives inside the gound of Silcar and bites through stones with its strong teeth.

	Hypnoid: A dangerous toadlike, wooly fellow. It jumps at an incredibly fast pace, while trying to hypnotize you with its eyes.

	Killer Salc: A genetically improved Salc with vicious jaws. Beware.

	Evil Eye: The creatures that controlled the fleet are controlling the beings on Silcar. One shot will blind them.

	Glutton: A small yellow guy with eyes bigger than its belly, or is it? It will try to eat keen, but will also be satisfied with a shot from keens gun.

	Cloud: Similar to the Thundercloud in the Shadowlands, this Cloud is in a bad mood.

	Gogantua: A giant monster at home in the deep caves of Silcar. When it is already grown up, it will spend most of the time sitting around and waiting for food, which is normally brought by the Salcs who worship it.

	Small Gogantua: As long as they're young they can get pretty annoying, because they're fast and hungry. They will swallow everything in their way.

	Blissard: A huge blue bubble-being, which is always in a good mood. And its mood is even getting better if it can kill anything with its electric bolts.
