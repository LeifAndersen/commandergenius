Games to port
=============

- Finish ScummVM build.

I'm not planning any more games to port.


Bugs to fix
===========

- Possibility to create custom key layout for on-screen keyboard.

- Add an option for overlay buttons transparency and button images size.

- Running OpenGL SwapBuffers in a separate thread - huge speed improvement expected.

- Show/hide screen controls with longpress on Text Edit button.

- Zoom and rotate multitouch gestures should return some keycodes.

- Right click by longpress.

- Option to calibrate touch area of the screen.

- Calling SDL_SetVideoMode() with SDL 1.3 makes it crash.

- Support for NDK r5.

And that's all, I won't be doing any more development or fix other bugs (see bugs.txt for details).
